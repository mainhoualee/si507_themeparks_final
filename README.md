# si507_themeparks_final

Required Python packages for this project are urllib, sqlite3, and plotly.

How to interact with the program:

Run the file themeparks.py in your terminal. When the file runs you will be given the choice to enter either 1 for Search Interface or 2 for Data Presentation. 
If you choose option 1, you will be prompted to enter a state name. You can enter any state name and a list of theme parks in that state will populate with information 
on the park name, opening year and address. You can continue to search entering other state names or choose to exit by entering “exit” on the command line. 
Once you have exited, the program closes. Therefore, you will need to run the file again to see the options once more and to choose option 2 for Data Presentation 
(or vice versa, depending on what option you initially chose). When option 2 is chosen, four options for chart displays will appear in a “Data Presentation Menu” and you 
can choose between the numbers 1 to 4. The charts are for: 1) Barplot of Number of Theme Parks in each State, 2) Histogram of Number of Theme Parks in each State, 
3) Barplot of Number of Theme Parks Opened Each Year, and 4) Histogram of Theme Park Name Lengths. The charts will open as a webpage through a server. Once the chart 
successfully loads and open, the program returns to the “Data Presentation Menu” and you can keep choosing different options or enter “exit” to exit, which will end the program. 

Keep in mind, you will need to re-run the program each time you "exit" and want to change from options 1 and 2. Once you are in either option 1 or 2, you can continue to
interact with the program for as long as you'd like.
